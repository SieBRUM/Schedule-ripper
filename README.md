# Schedule-ripper
This project is kind of an extention to my "Radius Rooster app". It automatically logs the user in with coded creditials (see const string USERNAME AND PASS).
It writes the found classes to a .xml file on desktop, so i dont have to manually do this myself.
So its not really that useful for anyone except me.
